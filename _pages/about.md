Hello, I’m **Puti Raissa**, a final-year Computer Science student at Universitas Indonesia with a strong academic foundation and a deep interest in **software engineering**, **artificial intelligence**, and **machine learning**.

Throughout my studies, I’ve worked on various projects that helped me understand how to build software that works well, is easy to maintain, and can scale when needed. I’ve also learned a lot from working in teams; collaborating, solving problems together, and adapting to different roles.

I specialize in building scalable backend systems using Python (Django) and Java (Spring Boot), and I have practical experience deploying robust applications using Docker and CI/CD tools. My current focus is on the intersection of AI and software architecture, demonstrated by my final-year research developing a full-stack application (FastAPI + React/Vite) to evaluate user interaction with Large Language Models (LLMs).

Beyond coding, I excel in collaboration and leadership. As a **Teaching Assistant** for courses in Fasilkom UI, I’ve mentored students, facilitated complex debugging sessions, and taught key system design concepts. These experiences have refined my ability to simplify technical ideas, lead teams, and maintain a patient, structured approach to problem-solving.
