Hello, I’m **Puti Raissa**, a final-year Computer Science student at Universitas Indonesia with a strong academic foundation and a deep interest in **software engineering**, **artificial intelligence**, and **machine learning**.

Throughout my studies, I’ve worked on various projects that helped me understand how to build software that works well, is easy to maintain, and can scale when needed. I’ve also learned a lot from working in teams; collaborating, solving problems together, and adapting to different roles.

Aside from studying, I also enjoy teaching. As a **Teaching Assistant** for *Introduction to Digital Systems* and *Platform Based Programming*, I’ve helped students during tutorials, reviewed assignments, and supported them in understanding key concepts. These experiences taught me how to explain technical ideas clearly and be more patient and structured when guiding others.
