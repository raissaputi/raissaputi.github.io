Pacilflix is a SQL-based streaming platform simulation developed as a team project for the Database Systems course. The application allows users to register, log in, browse content, leave reviews, manage subscriptions, and organize personal favorites and downloadsâ€”all backed by structured relational data.

The system is built using server-side rendering, focusing on core CRUD operations with robust database integration. The project emphasizes user interaction through dynamic data filtering, validation, and real-time updates to user state.

The project demonstrates a strong foundation in backend database design, SQL query usage, and integration between views and persistent data. It showcases how complex relational schemas and user flows can be implemented in a web-based media platform simulation.
