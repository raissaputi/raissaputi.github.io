Literahub is a web and mobile application designed to make reading and book sharing more accessible and interactive. Developed as a final project, Literahub allows users not only to borrow books, but also to contribute their own creative works, reserve reading spaces, participate in discussions, and share reviews with others.

The development started by learning the fundamentals of **full-stack web development using Django**, where both the frontend and backend were implemented using Djangoâ€™s built-in tools. After building and completing the web version, the project continued by exploring **the basics of mobile development using Flutter**, bringing Literahub to mobile devices with a responsive and user-friendly interface.
